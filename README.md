# osu! Collection Factory

## Dependencies:
- Python 3: [Download link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Python `requests` and `dotenv` modules: To install them enter the following commands in cmd or a terminal: 

    ```
    pip install requests
    ```
    ```
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```

**Note: Some collection names or file names may cause issues. If you get errors try using a basic name such as `collection.db` or `collection.html` instead.**

## How to dump osu!Collector collections:
1. Run "main.py", enter "1" to the prompt, choose if you want any special filtering <sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>, and enter the osu!Collector collectionID or URL. <sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>
2. You should have your collection.

## How to save your osu!api key:
1. Create file named `.env`
2. In `.env` write the following: `KEY="Your osu!api key here"`

## How to dump from a file:
1. Run "main.py", enter "2" to the prompt, enter in the path to the file, and your API key. 

## How to use with manual mapID list:
1. Add your list of mapIDs, map links, or set links to "list.txt" (the default "list.txt" path is `..\list.txt`). (Raw setIDs are not supported. Make sure your setIDs have the prefix of either `https://osu.ppy.sh/s/` or `https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/`)
2. Run "main.py", enter in the path to the file, and your API key. 


### Notes:
<p id="note1">1. If you want to filter by a min or max, enter 0 for the other option (ei: min=60, max=0). For a specific range,
                   note that the range is <b> exclusive </b>. </p>
<p id="note2">2. When downloading with a star rating or bpm filter, osu!Collector pages (one page = 100 maps) are
                   grabbed at 1 per second. Otherwise, all maps are grabbed instantly and all at once. </p>
